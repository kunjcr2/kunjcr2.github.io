    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-address-card"></i> About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a second-year international student at San Francisco State University, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer
        Science. Originally from Ahmedabad, India, where I completed my schooling, I am actively seeking opportunities that
        align with my academic background and allow me to contribute meaningfully to a professional environment. I have
        successfully cleared the JEE examination, recognized as the world’s second toughest competitive exam. Proficient in
        Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have worked on various projects, including a voice-activated assistant,
        volume gesture control, and a personal portfolio website, all showcasing practical problem-solving and creative coding
        abilities.

    <ol>
        <li><strong>1. Voice-Activated Assistant:</strong> Developed a voice-activated assistant using Python that employs natural language
        processing to understand and respond to user commands. The assistant can perform web searches, open websites, and
        provide location information.</li>
        <br><li><strong>2. Volume Gesture Control:</strong> Created a volume control system using OpenCV and MediaPipe that responds to hand gestures,
        allowing users to adjust audio levels seamlessly. This project includes specific gestures for controlling Spotify
        playback, enhancing user interaction with music applications.</li>
        <br><li><strong>3. Workout Assistant:</strong> Developed an AI-powered workout assistant using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. This project
        integrates live video streaming and real-time hand and body tracking to monitor exercise form and provide feedback on
        workout quality. The assistant features a responsive web interface built with Flask, which allows users to perform
        exercises while receiving visual feedback and improvement tips based on OpenAI-generated routines. This solution
        enhances the workout experience by offering personalized, data-driven insights into exercise performance.</li>
        <p><li><strong>Login Page Application (Node.js, Express.js, EJS, Mongoose)</strong><br>
            Excited to share a recent project where I developed a dynamic login page application! Using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS for the backend, along with HTML, 
            CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, I implemented robust user authentication with MongoDB and Mongoose. The app features dynamic content rendering, form 
            validation for accurate input, and a responsive design for seamless use across devices. This project allowed me to refine my full-stack development skills, 
            from server-side logic to database integration and UI responsiveness.
